            <div id="p-tile">
                <p>I am a software engineer student at Flatiron School. I could exclaim my excitement from a rooftop.
                    This career switch has got me feeling all sorts of thrill and nervous. These beginning stages of
                    integrating into tech have proved to be joy and purpose giving. I am ecstatic about building my
                    skill set as I push to become a software engineer.</p>
                <p>I currently reside in Grand Rapids, MI with my husband, Joe, and Australian Shepard, Ranger. If I’m
                    not behind my computer learning code, you will find me cooking a new recipe, reading, playing video
                    games, or walking outside with my pup. I make a great pour over coffee and my current feat in the
                    kitchen is the *perfect* chocolate chip cookie. I thrive in learning new things and strengthening
                    the skills I already possess.</p>
