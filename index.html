        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>I am a software engineer student at Flatiron School. I could exclaim my excitement from a rooftop. This
            career switch has got me feeling all sorts of thrill and nervous. These beginning stages of integrating into
            tech have proved to be joy and purpose giving. I am ecstatic about building my skill set as I push to become
            a software engineer.</p>
        <p>I currently reside in Grand Rapids, MI with my husband, Joe, and Australian Shepard, Ranger. If Iâ€™m not
            behind my computer learning code, you will find me cooking a new recipe, reading, playing video games, or
            walking outside with my pup. I make a great pour over coffee and my current feat in the kitchen is the
            *perfect* chocolate chip cookie. I adore learning new things and strengthening the skills I already possess.
